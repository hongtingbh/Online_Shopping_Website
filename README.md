## Project Description
Using the knowledge taught from the course, our group has created/designed a website called Micro Computers. Micro Computers is a website where users can purchase electronics such as computers, parts, etc. The application consists of two main users, admin user and customer user. The admin user has the ability to post, update, and delete items as well as manage user orders and more through the Django Admin Dashboard. The customer user has the option of creating an account, purchasing an item, searching for items, view their order history and much more.
